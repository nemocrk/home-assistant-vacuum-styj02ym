# Hacky support for STYJ02YM/STYTJ02YM
This hacky integration adds support for Xiaomi Robot Vacuum-Mop Pro, Viomi V2 Pro and other devices widely known as STYTJ02YM.  
Repository is forked from https://github.com/nqkdev/home-assistant-vacuum-styj02ym, I've backported changes from other forks, added HACS compatibility and polished it a bit.  
It works for me and ~20 other people, but due to my limited Python knowledge your milleage may vary.

--> merged some useful pull request
